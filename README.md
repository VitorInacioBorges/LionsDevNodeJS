## • Code Testing Method

In order to test the codes implemented it is necessary to:
- Clone the repository and it's codes in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) 
- Have NPM and Node.Js installed
- Run a line of code to execute the program inside your IDE

## • Tutorial

Installing sites:
- Node.Js + NPM: https://nodejs.org/pt/download

Step-by-Step:
- Select latest LTS version, your operational system, docker and NPM (all of these should be set by default).
- After the tools have been installed initialize a git repository in a directory on your machine with your IDE and write in the terminal:
'git init'.
- Create a GitHub repository in the site or in your IDE (both ways are fine). 
- Set your github settings with: 'git config --global user.name "username"' and 'git config --global user.email "email@gmail.com"'.
- Clone the repository with: 'git clone https://github.com/VitorInacioBorges/LionsDevNodeJS.git'
- Open the project file you want to run and in your integrated terminal write: 'node <file_name>'. It should run perfectly in your terminal.
